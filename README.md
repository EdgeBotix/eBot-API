Getting Started with eBot
=========

## eBot Description

[![solarized dualmode](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-yinyang.png)](#features)

eBots are a robust, 3D-printed versatile STEM learning robotics platform that provide modularity and customization options. eBots aim to bridge the link between theory and practice by providing the ideal platform for students to collaborate and use their combined knowledge to build the best solution to a task. EdgeBotix wants to build the best supporting community and provide resources for teaching, making it extremely easy to integrate into the curriculum, something not seen in current educational robots.  

### Technical Specification

The following are detailed technical specifications of the eBots:

*	**Interface**
    * Currently there are two interface with python language
        *   [Soar Interface](#soar) 
        *   [API interface](#features)

### Pairing eBot
* eBot could be paired by entering the pairing code "0000". If you want the step by step guide of pairing with your system you can click [here](#detailed pairing).

### Python Installation
You might need:
* [Python 2.7](http://epd-free.enthought.com/?Download=Download+EPD+Free+7.3-2) 

Soar
---------
This section assumes that you have Python 2.7 already installed. 
To install Digital World Library, follow the steps according to your platform:
1.	OS X and Linux:
   * Download SOAR-master.zip from the [github](https://github.com/EdgeBotix/SOAR)
   * Open Terminal
   * Go the directory/folder where you save the file, e.g. if you save it to Mac's default Downloads folder, then type :
```
    cd $HOME/Downloads
```
   * Unzip the file, e.g. type :
```
    tar SOAR-master.zip
```
   * Go to the SOAR-master folder, e.g. type:
```    
   cd SOAR-master
```
   * Install the library by typing:
```   
   sudo python setup.py install
```
2.	Windows:
    * Download SOAR-master.zip from the [github](https://github.com/EdgeBotix/SOAR)
   * Unzip the file
   * Open Command Prompt by typing "cmd" from the Start Menu
   * Go the directory/folder where you have unzipped the file, e.g. type :
``` 
    cd C:\Downloads\SOAR-master\
``` 
   * Install the library by typing:
``` 
   python setup.py install
``` 

### RUNNING SIMULATOR - SOAR
After you have installed the Digital World Library, you can run the
simulator, called SOAR. To run it, follow the steps below:
1. OS X and Linux:
   * Open Terminal
   * Go to the SOAR-master folder
   * Go to soar folder
   * Run soar by typing: 
``` 
	python runsoar.py
``` 

2. Windows:
    * Open Command Prompt by typing "cmd" from the Start Menu
    * Go to the folder where you store Digital World Library, e.g.:
``` 
    cd C:\Downloads\SOAR-master\
```
* Go to "soar" folder:
```
   cd soar
```
* Run soar by typing:
```
    python runsoar.py
```

### USING SIMULATOR - SOAR

1. Running the code and connect to eBot using wireless connection:
   * Run Soar 
   * Click "Simulator" button to load any Python files for the Worlds
   * Click "Brain" button and choose the Python files containing your robot brain
   * Click "START" button to start connection with EBot

WORLD

Some World files for simulation has been created ans it is part of the Digital Library Package. It is also included in this package under the folder "worlds".

BRAIN

A simple Brain file has been included: brainfile.py.
